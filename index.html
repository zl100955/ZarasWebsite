        <h2>About Australia</h2>
        <p>Australia is a country and continent surrounded by the Indian and Pacific oceans. Its major cities – Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide – are coastal.</p>
        <br> Australia is a beautiful country and a continent all in one. It is beautiful in its sense of rich and very long aboriginal culture, as well as its spectacular natural environment for example the Great Barrier Reef. The Australian society is very well educated with a literacy rate of 99% and overall Australia is a country with many great values. Australia is considered a developed nation and it has the world's thirteenth largest economy. It is known for high life expectancy, its education, quality of life, biodiversity and tourism.

Australia has one of the longest histories of any other country and a peaceful history also. Australians have been involved in very few wars but have been around for thousands of years. Aboriginal Indians and Torres Strait Islander People have inhabited Australia for around forty to sixty thousand years (DFAT).  Thos early people were also very strong in their tradition which is probably why 88% of all Australians attend at least one public cultural event per year, for example Australia is known for their city wide festivals in Brisbane and Sydney (DFAT). In 1945 the population was around 7 million but today there are about 23 million people living in Australia (DFAT). Of those 23 million people 26% of them are not natives (DFAT).

Many people think of Australians being “laid back” or “relaxed” because of their one of a kind English dialect and accent. The typical Australian accent is somewhat like a strong British accent but not quite. Some of the unique and common terms that Australians use are “the Barbie” referring to barbeques like we have in the United States. They also refer to their friends as “mates”.
